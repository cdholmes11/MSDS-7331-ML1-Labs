    "We have chosen to use an 80/20 train/test split with 10-fold cross validation. By keeping the 20% hold out and doing 10-fold cross-validation, we further reduce the chances of randomly splitting the data in a facorable way. We effectively get the benefits of 10-fold cross validations and offset the risk by keeping a 20% hold out for final model accuracy testing only. This removes our ability to train on the test set by repeatedly updating our model for better accuracy scores. "
